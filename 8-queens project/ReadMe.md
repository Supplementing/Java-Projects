# Eight-Queens Project

This project generates a chess board and places eight queens on the board with one in each column. It then uses a hillclimbing algorithm with random restarts in order to solve the board. A solved board is defined as: A board in which no queen is in conflict with one another and can make the moves a queen would make on a chess board.
